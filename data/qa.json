Ignore units or scales that are written separately from the tick, such as units and scales from the color bar label or the corner of the plot. If the chart does not have explicit labeled ticks on the horizontal color bar, answer 'Not Applicable'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",

If the first and the second charts do not have ticks with the same label on the horizontal axis, answer '0'.\nNote that your answer format should be as follows: Answer: The_answer_you_get",
